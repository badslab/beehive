Visium spatial transcriptomics data for the 101010 spatial transcriptomics project

Few example plots - each plot has many parameters that you can experiment with.

* [A boxplot showing NEAT1 expression comparing different APOE genotypes](/gene_expression?dataset_id=h.s423a.1&facet=apoe&gene=NEAT1)
* [A volcano plot showing differential expression comparing spots overlappig with plaques vs spots that do not overlap - highlighting KIF5A, APOE and TREM2](/volcano_plot?dataset_id=h.s423a.1&category=plaque_bin__res&genes=APOE%2CKIF5A%2CTREM2)
* [A scatterplot showing the relation between %mito and the expression of NEAT1 - colored by the expression of KIF5A](/scatter_expression?dataset_id=h.s423a.1&facet=488_sd&x_axis_radio=1&num_facetX=percent.mito&category_radio=1&geneY=NEAT1&gene_categorical=KIF5A)
