Visium spatial transcriptomics data for the 101010 spatial transcriptomics project


Few example plots:

* [A boxplot showing NEAT1 expression comparing different APOE genotypes](https://muna.bdslab.org/gene_expression?dataset_id=h.s423a.1&facet=apoe&gene=NEAT1)
* [A volcano plot showing differential expression comparing spots overlappig with plaques vs spots that do not overlap - highlighting KIF5A, APOE and TREM2](https://muna.bdslab.org/volcano_plot?dataset_id=h.s423a.1&category=plaque_bin__res&genes=APOE%2CKIF5A%2CTREM2)
